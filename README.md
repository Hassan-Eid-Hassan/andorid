## Project Overview

This Android application is a simple example to help DevOps engineers understand how to work with Android apps in a containerized environment. It can be used as a learning tool for creating and managing CI/CD pipelines and deploying Android applications to various environments.

## Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    cd your-repo
    ```

2. **Build the Docker image**:

    ```shell
    docker build -t android-app .
    ```

3. **Run the Docker container**:

    ```shell
    docker run -d -p 8080:8080 android-app
    ```

## Usage

Once the container is running, you can interact with the Android application through an emulator or device connected to the container.

## Creating a Pipeline

This repository serves as a learning platform for creating a DevOps pipeline. You can experiment with various CI/CD tools such as GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI/CD to create a pipeline that builds, tests, and deploys the Android application.

For example, you might:

- **Build** the application using Gradle.
- **Test** the application using JUnit, Espresso, or other testing frameworks.
- **Deploy** the app to an emulator, connected device, or cloud-based testing platform.

Feel free to explore and customize the pipeline according to your learning goals.
